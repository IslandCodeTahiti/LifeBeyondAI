# 👽 LifeBeyondAI

> *"We're not alone. We're just not smart enough to prove it... yet."

LifeBeyondAI is an experimental project aiming to **detect life beyond Earth** using **AI**, cross-referencing **scientific theories, astrophysics data**, and **alien possibility frameworks**.  
Our motto? **No limits. All possibilities. Pure exploration.**

---

## 🧠 Why this project?

In an era where AI deciphers protein structures and maps galaxies, it's time to take it a step further:  
**Can we train a model to estimate the probability of extraterrestrial life based on human knowledge?**

---

## 🚀 How it works

We combine:
- 🛰️ Public space datasets (NASA, ESA, Kepler, etc.)
- 📄 Thousands of scientific papers on astrobiology, exoplanets, and extremophile life
- 📚 Theoretical models and hypotheses (Fermi paradox, Drake equation, Zoo theory, etc.)

All this feeds into a neural architecture to **evaluate life probability across the cosmos**.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- 🛰️ Data ingestion pipeline for exoplanet databases and papers
- 🌌 Probabilistic modeling for life estimation
- 🗃️ Knowledge graphs to connect theories, locations, and hypotheses
